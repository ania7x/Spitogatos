1. Download and install XAMPP includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP  from https://www.apachefriends.org/ ( I downloaded the one for windows)

Open xampp , start apache php and mysql.


4.   Open phpMyAdmin:
        ◦ Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
        ◦ Log in with your MySQL root username and password.In the usual case it's username=root , password nothing, so just press enter on the password

5.  Once logged in, click on the "SQL" tab at the top of the page.
      Paste SQL Code:
        ◦ Copy the entire SQL code from the folder sql called users_house_posting.sql and then press Go.



6.   On your your web browser write localhost\spitogatos\run_at_first\index.php to add the first users.(Also check or change the file add_users for users and their passwords)
